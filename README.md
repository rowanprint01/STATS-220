# Stats 220 - Project 1

## Hello! This repo was made as part of my first project for STATS 220 at the University of Auckland! ðŸ˜ƒ

### The project introduced me to the markup language Markdown which is used to format plain text.

**Here are some of the things completing this project has taught me:**


1. A begginers understanding of how markdown works and how to use it.
2. How to write in **bold** and _italics_.
3. How to list items using both ordered and unordered bullet points.

* I have also learnt how to add hilarious images into my projects such as....

**This brings me to the end of the first part of my project, thanks for reading and all the best! ðŸ˜ƒ**
